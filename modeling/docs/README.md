This folder contains the models documentation of a system composed by a solar field, thermal storage and a Multi-Effect Distillation (MED) plant, referred as *SolarMED*.

This documentation is better visualized using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). If seen from Github webpage the latex equations will not show properly, and if visualized from an IDE such as VSCode internal links will not be correctly previewed.

>[!warning] This documentation might be outdated
>Since the documentation is written manually, changes made to the source code might not be reflected here in the documentation, that is why it's always recommended to also check the source code of the specific model, which will also contain documentation 

>[!info] Nomenclature
>Throughout the  documentation, some times the flow rates are referred as $q$ or as $\dot{m}$. Strictly speaking $q$ is a volumetric flow rate i.e. m³/h, while $\dot{m}$ is a mass flow rate (i.e. kg/s), but they are used interchangeably.

## Index
